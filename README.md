## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `about.html` or `index.html` in any modern web browser.

## Notes
- Image paths in the current HTML use absolute local file paths (e.g., `C:\Users\tirum\Downloads\apple.jpg`). For the website to work correctly online or on other devices, update these paths to relative paths within the project folder (e.g., `./images/apple.jpg`).
